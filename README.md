# Workshop-6
https://mirow-l.github.io/Workshop-6/

## Working with text (29/1/25)
- Started by copying what Leo was making with his poem generator thing which all felt familiar as I had explored some of these mechanics earlier on.
- Now I am looking into using RiTa to generate randomness within what people type.
- I am curious about adding an extra page that will record all the things people type down. Thinking about making a manefesto-like or decleration-like page where people can be making false "rules" or "laws" according to whatever they might be feeling which then gets added to a bigger text file which has all the rules anyone that has submitted has submitted, plus with the factor of randomness via RiTa.

## My Work
- I watched Leo using the tokenize tool on his workand so I decided to investigate the RiTa site to see what commands they have that I can use. This workshop requires three different functions to be used so I will find those now.
- To speed things up I tried using the AI website DeepSeek to try and edit my work

### However when I tried to run this code in VS Code it didn't work
- I tried to ask it again a few times but it gave me the same answer so I tried to figure it out by watching Leo's example again
- I asked DeepSeek a simplified question which gave a much better looking answer, I will try do this with the three RiTa functions

### It didn't work with the alliteration function which was frustrating

### Instead I added a Pluralise function with help from DeepSeek

### Finally I searched and found a working function which was adding a random adjective to the input which was fun, also with help from DeepSeek

## Finally Done
- Using DeepSeek was incredibly helpful and I will continue to use it for help when I get stuck. I also will ask Leo if I get stuck on things but since I am so behind I need to speed through these last few workshops.
